        Review the TypeScript/JavaScript code for NestJS best practices, dependency injection, module structure, and potential bugs.

        **Context Files (Do Not Review):**
        - `docs/design.md`
        - `src/core/error-handling/graphql.exception.filter.ts`
        - `src/core/error-handling/http.exception.filter.ts`
        - `src/core/error-handling/rest.error.response.ts`
        - `src/core/error-handling/unhandled.exception.filter.ts`

        **Guidelines:**
        - Our project uses global exception handlers (`UnhandledExceptionFilter`), so avoid suggesting additional `try/catch` blocks unless handling specific cases.
        - Refer to the design overview in the context files for better understanding.
