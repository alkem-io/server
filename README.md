# Alkemio Server

Welcome to the Alkemio Server! This server is the heart of the Alkemio Platform, and manages the representation of the ecoverse and all the entities stored wthin it.

A high level overview of the Design of the Alkemio Server is shown below.

</p>

The server primarily interacts via a _*GraphQL api*_' that it exposes. This can be found at the following location: <http://localhost:4000/graphql> (assuming default port).

This api is used by the [Alkemio Web Client](http://github.com/alkem-io/Client.Web), but also by any other clients / integrations that need to interact with the Alkemio server.

The key takeaway is that the Alkemio server is designed to be integrated, so that other tools or user interfaces can make use of the logical domain model maintained by the server.
