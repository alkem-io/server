# Configuration file for Alkemio.
#
# This is a YAML file: see [1] for a quick introduction. Note in particular
# that *indentation is important*: all the elements of a list or dictionary
# should have the same indentation.
#
# [1] https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
#
# For most of the configuration values there is a default supplied, this is after the ":".
# To overwrite the default value, set environment variable with the name as is shown before the ":".

## hosting ##
# The hosting configuration for the Alkemio Server
hosting:
  environment: ${ENVIRONMENT}:local
  # The port that the Alkemio server will be listening on.
  # For clusters (e.g. docker-compose, kubernetes) this should also be the port that is used  in the ingress configuration (e.g. traefik).
  # This is then used for routing the requests from the public-facing endpoint (e.g. https://dev.alkem.io/graphql)
  # to the alkemio-server service, orchestrated with the orchestration engine of your choice, e.g. kubernetes or docker-compose.
  # The graphql port is also used for internal communication between the services inside the e.g. kubernetes cluster.
  #
  port: ${GRAPHQL_PORT}:4000

  # The entry point for the cluster
  endpoint_cluster: ${ENDPOINT_CLUSTER}:http://localhost:3000

  # The path from the end point for all public api rest requests.
  # It is combined with the `endpoint` above to provide the full path for incoming requests targeting the public Rest api.
  #
  path_api_public_rest: ${PATH_API_PUBLIC_REST}:/api/public/rest

  # The path from the end point for all private api rest requests.
  # It is combined with the `endpoint` above to provide the full path for incoming requests targeting the public Rest api.
  #
  path_api_private_rest: ${PATH_API_PRIVATE_REST}:/api/private/rest

  # Support for subscriptions enabled or not. These require a WebSocket connection
  subscriptions:
    enabled: ${SUBSCRIPTIONS_ENABLED}:false

  max_json_payload_size: ${HOSTING_MAX_JSON_PAYLOAD_SIZE}:64mb
## bootstrap ##
# Used to determine the the information that is used to to initialize a functional Alkemio instance.
bootstrap:
  # The bootstrap authorization file specifies the minimum set of users and their associated credentials that are always available
  # in the Alkemio instance.
  #
  # Default: the default file that is picked up is: src/services/configuraiton/templates/authorization-bootstrap.json.
  authorization:
    enabled: ${BOOTSTRAP_AUTHORIZATION_ENABLED}:true
    file: ${BOOTSTRAP_AUTHORIZATION_FILE}

## security ##
# The various means by which the security of the Alkemio platform can be configured.
security:
  # cors settings for the application
  cors:
    # Need to be able to disable cors checks on the server when running behind another reverse proxy that is setting
    # a cors origin header e.g. oathkeeper
    enabled: ${CORS_ENABLED}:true

    # Origin of the graphql requests to the Alkemio Server.
    # Defaults to * (insecure, not recommended for production usage).
    # Change to a value that whitelists your request origin.
    origin: ${CORS_ORIGIN}:*

    # Cors methods allowed in the Alkemio Server.
    # Defaults to GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE.
    # Graphql uses mostly POST - the rest of the methods are left for utility REST endpoints.
    # If no REST endpoints are used (they are kept for ease of development) the list of allowed methods can be reduced.
    methods: ${CORS_METHODS}:GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE

    # Cors allowed headers.
    allowed_headers: ${CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS}:Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,Authorization

innovation_hub:
  header: ${INNOVATION_HUB_HEADER}:origin

## identity ##

# Defines all authentication and authorization configuration.
# Authentication is pluggable, using the notion of "Authentication Providers", which have the responsibility to authenticate users.
# Authorization is handled within the platform.
#
# Note: the term Authentication Provider is based on the more widely understood concept of Identity Providers (Servers, Services),
# but it is in Alkemio restricted to Authentication. Configuration is unique per provider.
#
# The only functionality used from an Authentication Provider is acquiring an access token (in other words, authentication) and
# extracting the users email .
# The email is used for matching the user account (provided from the Identity Server, e.g. Ory Kratos) to the user profile in Alkemio.
# Traditional Identity Provider functionality like federation, account management etc. are out-of-scope in Alkemio.
#
# Authorization is Credential-based, validating whether the user has valid credentials for the requested resource.
identity:
  ## authentication ##
  # Defines both the configuration required for the server to process authentication requests (via passportJS strategies) and the
  # client-side configuration required to authenticate to the Identity Servers (e.g. Ory Kratos) and generate
  # valid Authorization Header (Bearer access token).
  authentication:
    # A flag setting whether Authentication based on non-interactive login is enabled.
    api_access_enabled: ${AUTH_API_ENABLED}:true

    # Time-to-live of the cache for user authentication info (credentials, verified credentials) in seconds. Defaults to 60.
    cache_ttl: ${AUTH_CACHE_TTL}:60

    # A list of Identity Providers that can be used for authenticating the user.
    # The claims in the access token that are used in Alkemio are the user email and the token expiration time.
    providers:
      # Ory Kratos Next Gen Identity Provider (https://github.com/ory/kratos).
