\
The elements of informational text are evident in two areas: purpose and formatting. The purpose of informational text is to deliver factual information about a designated topic. Informational text is not fictional. The formatting of informational text can vary somewhat depending on the type of text and its length.

\
**Written cues** are those visual variations in a written text that draw the reader's attention to specific words or phrases. Informational text written cues include bold type and italics, two font changes that add emphasis. Many informational texts use bold type for vocabulary words or other key terms.

The purpose of informational text images is to increase reader understanding and make the written text more memorable.\
