An additional organizational tool is an index. The **index** appears in the back of a book and lists keywords and the page numbers where that word can be found. An index is helpful for readers making a specific search because it lists words rather than topics. Indexes can be helpful for finding vocabulary words, names, and places within a text.\

The white tiger is a type of feline subspecies of the Bengal tiger. It has almost no orange pigmentation. It is for this reason that its fur is white and from there it derives its name. Despite the black stripes it maintains its pigmentation. Regarding their size or size, these tigers are usually slightly larger than the orange tigers. Due to this condition (lack of pigmentation), white tigers have been classified as exotic [animals](https://www.exampleslab.com/15-examples-of-the-animal-kingdom/) and are a source of great tourist attraction.\

The first element of text formatting is organization. Informational text organization begins with a **table of contents**, which is a list of chapter titles and their corresponding page numbers. Some tables of contents also list page numbers for charts and diagrams. The table of contents comes at the beginning of the book and gives the order in which topics appear in the book. Instead of reading the entire book to find the desired information, the table of contents allows readers to skip to the topic that is most interesting or best answers their questions.\

Informational text uses **images and graphics** to enhance the depth and quality of information presented. An informational text image like a photograph adds visual details to something being described. Informational text graphics like charts and tables can make textual and numerical data easier to understand and use. Many images and graphics are accompanied by written captions that tie them into the rest of the text. Informational graphics might also be icons to highlight specific topics or points, such as a lightbulb printed next to a main point or a tiny calendar printed next to a date to remember. The purpose of informational text images is to increase reader understanding and make the written text more memorable.\

5.  In addition, Bataille has been clear in this regard, distancing his position from the typical mortuary fascination of post-Romantics, opposing work as ordering and repression to the fascination for violence (Bataille, 2001).\

Informational text uses **images and graphics** to enhance the depth and quality of information presented. An informational text image like a photograph adds visual details to something being described. Informational text graphics like charts and tables can make textual and numerical data easier to understand and use. Many images and graphics are accompanied by written captions that tie them into the rest of the text. Informational graphics might also be icons to highlight specific topics or points, such as a lightbulb printed next to a main point or a tiny calendar printed next to a date to remember. The purpose of informational text images is to increase reader understanding and make the written text more memorable.\

\
**Written cues** are those visual variations in a written text that draw the reader's attention to specific words or phrases. Informational text written cues include bold type and italics, two font changes that add emphasis. Many informational texts use bold type for vocabulary words or other key terms. Printing section headings in a larger font is another common written cue that allows readers to quickly locate a particular section of text.\

Holland is a region that belongs to the Netherlands, a country in Europe. The term ‚ÄúNetherlands‚Äù is often confused with ‚ÄúHolland‚Äù ‚Äì Holland only includes 2 regions out of the 12 that make up the Netherlands. This territory is divided into two provinces or states since 1840, thus forming ‚ÄúNorth Holland‚Äù and ‚ÄúSouth Holland‚Äù.\

\
The elements of informational text are evident in two areas: purpose and formatting. The purpose of informational text is to deliver factual information about a designated topic. Informational text is not fictional. The formatting of informational text can vary somewhat depending on the type of text and its length. However, organizational elements such as the index, table of contents, written cues, and images are all important information text features.\
\
Because of its purpose and design, informational text is an easy way for readers to locate specific information. Readers can find titles related to a question or topic, then check text features to see if their chosen title contains relevant information. A reader looking to learn something new can browse titles and glance at text features to find a text that is of interest.\

Informational text uses **images and graphics** to enhance the depth and quality of information presented. An informational text image like a photograph adds visual details to something being described. Informational text graphics like charts and tables can make textual and numerical data easier to understand and use. Many images and graphics are accompanied by written captions that tie them into the rest of the text. Informational graphics might also be icons to highlight specific topics or points, such as a lightbulb printed next to a main point or a tiny calendar printed next to a date to remember. The purpose of informational text images is to increase reader understanding and make the written text more memorable.\

\
The first element of text formatting is organization. Informational text organization begins with a **table of contents**, which is a list of chapter titles and their corresponding page numbers. Some tables of contents also list page numbers for charts and diagrams. The table of contents comes at the beginning of the book and gives the order in which topics appear in the book. Instead of reading the entire book to find the desired information, the table of contents allows readers to skip to the topic that is most interesting or best answers their questions.\
\
An additional organizational tool is an index. The **index** appears in the back of a book and lists keywords and the page numbers where that word can be found. An index is helpful for readers making a specific search because it lists words rather than topics. Indexes can be helpful for finding vocabulary words, names, and places within a text.\

\
It is a receptor that converts energy. Although the lamp is commonly known as a unified object, the truth is that it can be divided into two parts: on one side is the *luminary* (which is the device that serves as a support) and the *proper lamp*¬†which is the device that produces the light (bulb, bulb, etc).\
\
Although originally the lamps only have the function of lighting a room or sector of the home, there are lamps of all kinds and a great classification can be made according to their age, their price, their durability, their style, etc.\
