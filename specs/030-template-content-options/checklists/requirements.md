# Specification Quality Checklist: Template Content Options

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

### Validation Details

- **Content Quality**: The spec focuses on user actions (administrator selecting template options) and business outcomes (content management flexibility) without mentioning specific technologies.
- **Requirements**: All 10 functional requirements are testable with clear expected behaviors. The scope is well-bounded to the single mutation enhancement.
- **Success Criteria**: All criteria are user/business focused (e.g., "complete content replacement within a single operation") rather than technical metrics.
- **Edge Cases**: Four key edge cases are documented covering cancellation, empty templates, transaction failures, and cascading content cleanup.
