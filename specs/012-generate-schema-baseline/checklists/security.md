# Security Checklist: Automated Schema Baseline Generation

**Purpose**: Validate that signing, permissions, and integrity-related requirements are complete and review-ready for the schema baseline automation.
**Created**: 2025-10-29
**Feature**: [specs/012-generate-schema-baseline/spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are GitHub permissions and branch protection expectations for the automation actor explicitly documented so reviewers can confirm commit rights? [Gap, Spec §Functional Requirements, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK002 Are escalation/notification channels (team name, contact method) enumerated for FR-006 rather than implied by “owning team”? [Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is the phrase “differences are validated” defined with objective checks before committing the baseline (e.g., required diff gates or approvals)? [Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the expected format and content of maintainer notifications (links, diff summary, remediation steps) spelled out to avoid ambiguity? [Spec §User Story 3, Plan §Summary]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do assumptions about GPG key availability align between the Spec and Quickstart (e.g., key storage, fingerprint)? [Spec §Assumptions, Quickstart §4]
- [ ] CHK006 Are diff visibility requirements consistent across User Story 2 and the plan’s “publish-baseline” helper description? [Spec §User Story 2, Plan §Summary]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK007 Do success criteria include a measurable target for failure notification latency to match FR-006 obligations? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK008 Are recovery steps specified for signed commit failures such as rejected fast-forwards or invalid signatures? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases, Plan §Constraints]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Are concurrent merge scenarios detailed enough to confirm how the workflow resolves push conflicts after serialization? [Spec §Edge Cases, Plan §Technical Context]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK010 Are security requirements for storing and rotating the automation GPG key documented (e.g., secret scope, rotation cadence)? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions, Quickstart §4]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK011 Are all third-party GitHub Actions pinned with justification for trust and update cadence to satisfy dependency governance? [Plan §Technical Context, Research §Decision 2]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK012 Is the terminology for “maintainers,” “owning team,” and “CODEOWNERS” clarified to prevent conflicting accountability? [Spec §FR-006, Research §Decision 4]
