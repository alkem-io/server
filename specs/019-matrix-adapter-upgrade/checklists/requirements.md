# Specification Quality Checklist: Upgrade Matrix Adapter to 0.7.0 & Use ActorID

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-26
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - *Exception: Feature is a library upgrade/refactor, so specific library versions and ID fields are required context.*
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - *See above exception.*
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - *See above exception.*

## Notes

- The feature is inherently technical (library upgrade and data model refactoring), so some technical details (library names, field names) are necessary in the specification.
