   * Overwrites the default behaviour of what to return when resolving the unresolved result for a key.
   * This is useful when the result is expected to be null, and it's not an exceptional case.
   * ---
   * The default behaviour is determined by the Loader decorator on the dataloader`s creation.
   * If the underlying graphql field, for which the dataloader is created, is nullable - the result can be resolved to null.
   * <br/>
   * Example:
   * ```
   * @ResolveField(() => ICallout, {
   *   nullable: true,
   *   description: 'The Callout that was published.',
   * })
   * public callout(
   *   @Parent() { payload }: InAppNotificationCalloutPublished,
   *   @Loader(CalloutLoaderCreator) loader: ILoader<ICallout | null>
   * ) {
   *   return loader.load(payload.calloutID);
   * }
   * ```
   * The `callout` is decorated as nullable, so the dataloader will auto-resolve to `null` if the result is not found.
   * <br/>
   * You can override this behaviour by setting the option to `false`. That way the problematic values will always be resolved to errors.
