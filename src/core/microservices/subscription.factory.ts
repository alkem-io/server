            // The topic exchange type is often used to implement various publish/subscribe pattern variations. Topic exchanges are commonly used for the multicast routing of messages.
            // DIRECT - A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on the message routing key.
            // A direct exchange is ideal for the unicast routing of messages (although they can be used for multicast routing as well).
            // HEADERS - A headers exchange is designed for routing on multiple attributes that are more easily expressed as message headers than a routing key. Headers exchanges ignore the routing key attribute.
            // Instead, the attributes used for routing are taken from the headers attribute. A message is considered matching if the value of the header equals the value specified upon binding.
            // FANOUT - A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to it and the routing key is ignored.
            // If N queues are bound to a fanout exchange, when a new message is published to that exchange a copy of the message is delivered to all N queues.
