          '# ü§ñ What is a Virtual Contributor?\n\nThink of it as a dynamic repository of knowledge with which you can interact. Powered by generative AI, these bots provide answers based on the documents and texts they were trained on. Unlike generic chatbots, the Virtual Contributor responds only to questions it can confidently answer.\n\n# üõ†Ô∏è How to make your own:\n\n1.  Learn More in this <strong>Introduction</strong>: Discover additional details about the Virtual Contributor and how you can interact with it.\n2.  Build Your <strong>Knowledge Base</strong>: Click the next step in the flow to create the body of knowledge you want to train your Virtual Contributor on.\n3.  Read how to Publish Your VC in <strong>Going Live</strong>: Once you‚Äôve crafted your Virtual Contributor, publish it so anyone in your Space can interact with it!\n\n# ‚ùóKeep in mind:\n\nAlkemio is currently in Public Preview. We invite you to join us in shaping a better future with safe technology and responsible AI usage. The Virtual Contributor is available to Spaces with a Plus subscription. Even if your subscription (or the free trial) ends, your Virtual Contributor will remain accessible, although it won‚Äôt answer new questions.\n',
