# üß† AI Model Card Template

A structured overview of an AI engine's attributes, designed for transparency, traceability, and ethical usage.

---

Model cards, especially for AI engines and large language models, typically include a structured set of **attributes** to promote transparency, reproducibility, safety, and usability. These attributes help users understand what the model is, how it works, what data it's trained on, and under what circumstances it should (or should not) be used.

Below is a categorized list of **commonly used attributes** in model cards related to AI engines:
