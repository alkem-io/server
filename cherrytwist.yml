# Configuration file for Cherrytwist.
#
# This is a YAML file: see [1] for a quick introduction. Note in particular
# that *indentation is important*: all the elements of a list or dictionary
# should have the same indentation.
#
# [1] https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html
#
# For most of the configuration values there is a default supplied, this is after the ":".
# To overwrite the default value, set environment variable with the name as is shown before the ":".

## hosting ##
# The hosting configuration for the Cherrytwist Server
hosting:
  # The port that the CT server will be listening on.
  # For clusters (e.g. docker-compose, kubernetes) this should also be the port that is used  in the ingress configuration (e.g. traefik).
  # This is then used for routing the requests from the public-facing endpoint (e.g. https://dev.cherrytwist.org/graphql)
  # to the ct-server service, orchestrated with the orchestration engine of your choice, e.g. kubernetes or docker-compose.
  # The graphql port is also used for internal communication between the services inside the e.g. kubernetes cluster.
  #
  port: ${GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT}:4000

  # The type of environment is used in multiple places to determine whether dev tooling is enabled.
  # The tyoe of environment can also be used for monitoring / logging / analysis in an ELK cluster / ElasticCloud instance.
  # For production deployments it should be set to Prod.
  #
  # Options: Dev, Prod
  environment: ${ENVIRONMENT}:Dev

## bootstrap ##
# Used to determine the the information that is used to to initialize a functional Cherrytwist instance.
bootstrap:
  # The bootstrap authorisation file specifies the minimum set of users and their associated credentials that are always available
  # in the Cherrytwist instance.
  #
  # Default: the default file that is picked up is: src/services/configuraiton/templates/authorisation-bootstrap.json.
  authorisationBootstrapPath: ${AUTH_BOOTSTRAP_PATH}

## security ##
# The various means by which the security of the Cherrytwist platform can be configured.
security:
  # cors settings for the application
  cors:
    # Origin of the graphql requests to the Cherrytwist Server.
    # Defaults to * (insecure, not recommended for production usage).
    # Change to a value that whitelists your request origin.
    origin: ${CORS_ORIGIN}:*

    # Cors methods allowed in the Cherrytwist Server.
    # Defaults to GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE.
    # Graphql uses mostly POST - the rest of the methods are left for utility REST endpoints.
    # If no REST endpoints are used (they are kept for ease of development) the list of allowed methods can be reduced.
    methods: ${CORS_METHODS}:GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE

    # Cors allowed headers.
    allowedHeaders: ${CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS}:Origin,X-Requested-With,Content-Type,Accept,Authorization

## identity ##

# Defines all authentication and authorization configuration.
# Authentication is pluggable, using the notion of "Authentication Providers", which have the responsibility to authenticate users.
# Authorisation is handled within the platfor.
#
# Note: the term Authentication Provider is based on the more widely understood concept of Identity Providers (Servers, Services),
# but it is in Cherrytwist restricted to Authentication. Configuration is unique per provider.
#
# The only functionality used from an Authentication Provider is acquiring an access token (in other words, authentication) and
# extracting the users email .
# The email is used for matching the user account (provided from the Identity Server, e.g. Ory Kratos) to the user profile in Cherrytwist.
# Traditional Identity Provider functionality like federation, account management etc. are out-of-scope in Cherrytwist.
#
# Authorization is Credential-based, validating whether the user has valid credentials for the requested resource.
identity:
  ## authentication ##
  # Defines both the configuration required for the server to process authentication requests (via passportJS strategies) and the
  # client-side configuration required to authenticate to the Identity Servers (e.g. Ory Kratos) and generate
  # valid Authorization Header (Bearer access token).
  authentication:
    # A flag setting whether Authentication is enabled on Cherrytwist.
    enabled: ${AUTH_ENABLED}:true

    # A flag setting whether Authentication based on non-interactive login is enabled.
    api_access_enabled: ${AUTH_API_ENABLED}:true

    # A list of Identity Providers that can be used for authenticating the user.
    # The claims in the access token that are used in Cherrytwist are the user email and the token expiration time.
    providers:
      # Ory Kratos Next Gen Identity Provider (https://github.com/ory/kratos).
      ory:
        # Issuer of the kratos cookie. The cookie can be used as is or mutated by
        # Ory Oathkeeper into an ID token. The session can be found at (default)
